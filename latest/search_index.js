The default is Basic which only has one process running at a time. Cycler instead has a process queue per window, meaning that if you quit the REPL (Ctrl+j+ Ctrl+o) then there exists an already running process which will seamlessly replace it. Server has a shared process queue between all windows, resulting in less process (2+n vs 2n where n is the number of windows) with more interactions (thus less safe).\nDeprecation Warnings: Checkbox for whether to show the Julia deprecation warnings in the console.\nOptimization Level: Sets the -O optimization level for the Julia LLVM compiler. The default is 3 corresponding to -O3 which is the default for the Julia REPL. Higher levels take longer to compile but produce faster code.\nJulia Options Precompiled:\nEnable Powershell Wrapper (Windows): Use a Powershell wrapper to spawn Julia. This is required in order to allow interrupts.\nNotifications: Enables the popup notifications from evaluations\nError Notifications: Enables the error notification windows to be displayed as well as in the console.\nEnable Menu: Enables the Julia menu in the menu bar. This option requires a restart of Atom for the change to take effect.\nEnable Tool Bar: Shows the Julia icons in the tool bar. This option requires a restart of Atom for the change to take effect.\nMaximum Console Size: Limits the Console history's size. The default value is 10,000. A larger history requires more memory and may slow down Atom, but will allow for more of the display to be saved.\nTerminal. The command which is used to open a terminal.\nErrors to Console: Denotes whether the error messages will be printed to the console.\nLaunch on Startup: Denotes whether the Julia process will be started when the Atom window is opened."

Julia will automatically use older versions on the Julia-side packages, but Atom will always give you the most up-to-date packages it knows about, which causes this issue. The easy way to solve this is to always use the current Julia release. Otherwise, resort to the Developer Install for the Atom packages and use git to checkout an older version. This requires some git know-how, so it's only recommended if the older version of Julia is truly necessary."

Note that this installation method for the Atom packages will allow them to be update each commit via the Atom package manager."

Messages are JSON objects, with a type header to tell the receiver how the message should be handled.The code handling low-level communication is kept in client.coffee and comm.jl. However, the details of those files aren't particularly important â€“ you only need to understand the communication API, which we'll go over here."

    "title": "Sending messages from Atom",
    "category": "section",
    "text": "Communication works by sending messages with an appropriate type on one side and registering handlers for that type on the other. The handler then takes some action and returns data to the original sender. For example, on the Atom side messages are sent in CoffeeScript as follows:client.msg 'eval', '2+2'On the Julia side, we need to set up a handler for this message, which happens as follows:handle(\"eval\") do code\n  eval(parse(code))\nendThis is a very simplified version of the eval handler that you can find in the Atom.jl source code. It simply evaluates whatever it's given and returns the result â€“ in this case, 4.Often we want to do something with that return result in Atom â€“ in this case, we'd like to display the result. We don't need to change anything on the Julia side to accomplish this; we can just use the rpc function from JS:client.rpc('eval', '2+2').then (result) =>\n  console.log dataThis call sends the eval message, pulls the result field out of the returned JSON, and displays the result, 4, in the console.This approach is exactly how Atom gets evaluation results, autocompletion and more from Julia â€“ so it's easy to find more examples spread throughout the julia-client and Atom.jl source code.As a first project, try implementing an Atom command (see the Atom docs) which sends this message to Julia, as well as adding the Julia handler above to Atom.jl. (You'll want to use a type other than eval to avoid clashes with actual evaluation.)"

The data was passed to Atom and simply returned as-is. Try changing the handler to modify the data before returning it.This mechanism is how Julia commands like Atom.select() are implemented, and in general it makes it very simple for Julia to control the Atom frontend â€“ see frontend.jl and frontend.coffee"

    "text": "A good way to get a handle on this stuff is just to use console.log and @show, on the Atom and Julia sides respectively, to take a peek at what's going over the wire. For example, it's easy to change the above Julia handler tohandle(\"eval\") do data\n  @show data\n  @show Dict(:result => eval(parse(data[\"code\"])))\nendThis will show you both the data being sent to Julia (in the example above, Dict(\"code\"=>\"2+2\")) and the data being sent back to Atom (Dict(:result => 4)). Modifying say, the completions handler in a similar way will show you what completion data Julia sends back to Atom (there will probably be a lot, so try looking at specific keys, for example).You don't need to reload Atom or restart the Julia client every time you make a change like this. If you open a file from the Atom.jl source code, you should see from the status bar that Juno knows you're working with the Atom module (try evaluating current_module() if you're not sure). Evaluating handlers from within the Atom module will show you what message types are currently defined. If you change a handler, just press C-Enter to update it in place; you should see the effect of your update immediately next time the handler is triggered. For example, if you modify the eval handler as follows:handle(\"eval\") do data\n  println(data[\"code\"]) # <- insert this line\n  # ...and update it, you should find that the next time you evaluate you see the contents of the current editor dumped into the console. Thus, most features or fixes you'd want to add to Juno can be made without a long edit â€“ compile â€“ run cycle."
