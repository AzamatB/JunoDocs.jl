# Settings

- **Julia Path**: The location of the Julia binary. This is the command that Atom uses to call Julia. It defaults to the command `julia` which requires that Julia has been added to the path. If Julia is not in the path, this must be the path to the Julia binary.
- **Boot Mode**: This is the type of process list that atom-julia-client is using.
  -  The default is `Basic`, which only has one process running at a time.
  - `Cycler` instead has a process queue per window, meaning that if you quit the REPL (`Ctrl+j`+ `Ctrl+o`) then there exists an already running process which will seamlessly replace it.
  - `Server` has a shared process queue between all windows, resulting in less processes (`2+n` vs `2n` where `n` is the number of windows), but is still experimental. **Currently disabled due to instability.**
- **Deprecation Warnings**: Checkbox for whether to show the Julia deprecation warnings in the console.
- **Optimization Level**: Sets the `-O` optimization level for the Julia LLVM compiler. The default is `3` corresponding to `-O3` which is the default for the Julia REPL. Higher levels take longer to compile but produce faster code.
- **Enable Powershell Wrapper** (Windows only): Use a Powershell wrapper to spawn Julia. This is required in order to allow interrupts.
- **Notifications**: Enables popup notifications when the evaluation finishes.
- **Error Notifications**: When evaluating a script, this will show a popup when errors are encountered instead of only printing the error to the console.
- **Enable Menu**: Enables the Julia menu in the menu bar. This option requires a restart of Atom for the change to take effect.
- **Enable Tool Bar**: Shows the Julia icons in the tool bar. This option requires a restart of Atom for the change to take effect.
- **Use Standard Layout**: Sets up a classical IDE UI (editor, console, and workspace) on startup.
- **Maximum Console Size**: Limits the number of displayed lines in the Console (default: 10,000). A larger value will display more entries at the cost of slowing down Atom.
- **Terminal**: The command which is used to open a new REPL.
- **Result Display Mode**: Determines where the result of an inline evaluation is displayed:
  - **Float results next to code**
  - **Display results under code**
  - **Display results in the console**
